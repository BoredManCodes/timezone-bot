**New Feature**
- PMing the bot will now function just like the `t!timein` command! Just send it a location, i.e. 'india', and it'll give you the time.
- Added a `t!support` command to paste the support server link

**Upgrades**
- `t!role` command now doesn't require @ing the entire role! The text search is not fuzzy, however, so be sure to type the exact role name.
- Added a "seconds" parameter to the `t!deleteresponse` command â€” use `t!deleteresponse 30` to delete responses after 30 seconds, and so on
- Added total user count and UTC offsets to `t!all` command

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed a bug where the suppresswarnings option interfered with response deletion
